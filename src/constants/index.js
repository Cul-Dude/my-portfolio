export const ABOUT_TEXT=`Besides programming, I'm a badass and versatile dude. I hit the gym like a beast, dominate all kinds of sports, and even crush it in state-level cricket. Music? Oh yeah, I shred the guitar, belt out tunes, and put on mini-concerts for my lucky loved ones. I'm an extroverted chatterbox who loves dropping knowledge bombs and soaking up wisdom from others. And, oh baby, I'm an MCU fanatic‚ÄîIron Man, Deadpool , Thor‚Äîyou name it, I love them all.

When it comes to programming, I've worked with a variety of technologies, building projects that have leveled up my skills and blown my mind with new tricks. I'm all about that teamwork life, loving every bit of group projects, hackathons, you name it. Leading the charge? Hell yeah, I've got the leadership chops to steer the ship. Solving complex problems to deliver kickass solutions is my jam. So, in a nutshell, I'm all about staying active, geeking out over new tech, and diving into open-source projects.`
